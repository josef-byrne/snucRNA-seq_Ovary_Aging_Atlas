# snucRNA-seq Postmenopausal Human Ovary Aging Atlas

Code associated with a single-nucleus RNA-seq atlas of the aging postmenopausal human ovary preprint: **Single-nucleus profiling reveals age-associated remodeling opposed by parity in the postmenopausal human ovary** (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.05.11.724381v1).

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and notebooks used to process 10x Genomics Flex snucRNA-seq data, curate donor/sample metadata, perform cell type annotation, and run downstream analyses including pseudobulk differential expression, GTEx ovary bulk RNA-seq deconvolution, compositional modeling, Milo neighborhood-level differential abundance analysis, and cell-cell communication analysis.

The scripts are numbered to reflect the approximate order of the analysis workflow.

  Cell Ranger multi configuration CSV files used by `1a_OvaryAtlas_cellranger.sh` for each multiplexed plex.

- **1b_cellbender_jupyter.ipynb**  
  Runs CellBender-based ambient RNA correction and prepares corrected sample-level matrices for downstream preprocessing.

- **1c_metadata_prep.ipynb**  
  Curates donor and sample metadata for downstream integration and analysis.

- **1d_preprocessing_jupyter.ipynb**  
  Performs per-sample preprocessing, quality-control filtering, doublet annotation, metadata integration, StressScore scoring per nuclei, and merging into a combined AnnData object.

### 2. Cell type annotation

- **2a_init_annot_jupyter.ipynb**  
  Performs initial atlas-wide integration, clustering, doublet review/removal, and broad compartment annotation.

### 3. Downstream analyses

- **3a_DGE_pathways.R**  
  Performs cell type-level pseudobulk differential gene expression analysis and pathway enrichment analysis.

- **3b_GTEx_decon.R**  
  Performs GTEx ovary bulk RNA-seq deconvolution using the ovary snucRNA-seq reference augmented with an erythrocyte reference.

- **3c_sccomp_analy.R**  
  Runs coarse cell type compositional analysis on snucRNA-seq and GTEx-deconvolved bulk RNA-seq data using sccomp.

- **3d_milo_analy.R**  
  Runs Milo neighborhood-level differential abundance analysis in the immune compartment and downstream macrophage neighborhood analyses.

- **3e_cell_comms.ipynb**  
  Performs cell-cell communication analysis using LIANA+ and Tensor-cell2cell.

### 4. Helper and reference-preparation scripts

- **4a_utils_OvaryAtlas.py**  
  Python utility functions used across annotation and analysis notebooks.

- **4b_tabula_sapiens_erythrocyte_reference_prep.ipynb**  
  Prepares a Tabula Sapiens-derived erythrocyte-enriched reference used for GTEx deconvolution.

- **4c_sccomp_outlier_plot_helpers.R**  
  Helper functions for plotting sccomp model results with censored outlier sample-by-cell-type pairs shown explicitly.
